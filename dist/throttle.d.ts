/**
 * Throttle execution of a function. Especially useful for rate limiting
 * execution of handlers on events like resize and scroll.
 *
 * @param {number} delay -                  A zero-or-greater delay in milliseconds. For event callbacks, values around 100 or 250 (or even higher)
 *                                            are most useful.
 * @param {Function} callback -               A function to be executed after delay milliseconds. The `this` context and all arguments are passed through,
 *                                            as-is, to `callback` when the throttled-function is executed.
 * @param {object} [options] -              An object to configure options.
 * @param {boolean} [options.noTrailing] -   Optional, defaults to false. If noTrailing is true, callback will only execute every `delay` milliseconds
 *                                            while the throttled-function is being called. If noTrailing is false or unspecified, callback will be executed
 *                                            one final time after the last throttled-function call. (After the throttled-function has not been called for
 *                                            `delay` milliseconds, the internal counter is reset).
 * @param {boolean} [options.noLeading] -   Optional, defaults to false. If noLeading is false, the first throttled-function call will execute callback
 *                                            immediately. If noLeading is true, the first the callback execution will be skipped. It should be noted that
 *                                            callback will never executed if both noLeading = true and noTrailing = true.
 * @param {boolean} [options.debounceMode] - If `debounceMode` is true (at begin), schedule `clear` to execute after `delay` ms. If `debounceMode` is
 *                                            false (at end), schedule `callback` to execute after `delay` ms.
 *
 * @returns {Function} A new, throttled, function.
